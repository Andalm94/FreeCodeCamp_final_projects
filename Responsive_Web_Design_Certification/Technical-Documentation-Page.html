                <p>Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a real-time strategy computer game set in the Middle Ages. 
                    It was released in 1999, and is the second main title of the Age of Empires series developed by 
                    Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft.</p>
                <p>Due to its commercial success, an expansion pack was released; Age of Empires II: The Conquerors,
                    followed by a Gold Edition, which bundled together the two games along with a bonus map and
                    game matches recorded by Microsoft strategy experts.</p>
                <p>The player has control over a society and guides them through four different time periods or "ages". 
                    The game begins in the Dark Age, where very few buildings and units are available. 
                    After a short time when requirements are met, the user gains the ability to advance their civilization
                    beginning with the Feudal Age, where more upgrades, buildings, and units become available. 
                    The next age is the Castle Age, in which the powerful Castle may be built, and used to produce 
                    powerful units including the unique unit of each civilization. Finally, the user can reach the 
                    Imperial Age, which is reminiscent of the early years of the Renaissance. Once the user has reached 
                    the Imperial Age, they gain access to all the upgrades, units, and buildings that may be built and 
                    researched for their specific civilization.</p>

                <p>The Britons are a Western European civilization in Age of Empires II. They represent the English and 
                    the Anglo-Normans during the High Middle Ages and Late Middle Ages. They focus on foot archers. 
                    The Britons' unique unit is the Longbowman, from their historical use of the English Longbow in their 
                    campaigns. Longbowmen are archers with higher range than every other archer in the game, even outranging 
                    Castles and towers in later stages of the game.</p>

            <article>
                <p>The Franks are a Western European civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on cavalry.</p>
                <p>The Franks conquered and inhabited modern day France, which was previously known as Gaul. 
                    They are primarily an offensive civilization, although they possess a few defensive perks as well. 
                    Their unique unit is the Throwing Axeman, which deals melee damage at range. Throwing axes were more 
                    popular than bows in the densely forested parts of northern Europe where the Franks came from, and they 
                    even take their name from their throwing axe, the Francisca. Their Castle Age unique technology, 
                    Bearded Axe, reflect this by giving their Throwing Axemen more range. The Frankish King Charlemagne 
                    started the tradition of using armored cavalry who became known as knights, and Frankish Knights fight 
                    valiantly with more HP and greater Line of Sight. This tradition also spawned the concept of Chivalry 
                    (codes of knights), represented by the technology of the same name which boosts their Stables' working 
                    speed. Castles dot France, and the Franks get cheaper Castles to better emulate this. Finally, no Castle 
                    with a knight as its lord is complete without peasant labor, and thus, Frankish Farms upgrade for free and 
                    their Foragers work faster.</p>

                <p>The Teutons are a Central European civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on infantry.</p>
                <p>"Teutons" was a name taken from an ancient tribe of Germany, which was used during the Middle Ages to 
                    designate the Germans. In the game, they are based on the Holy Roman Empire, which extended throughout 
                    Germany and its surroundings, as well as northern Italy. The Empire was born in the 10th century and 
                    survived until the 19th century.

            <article>
                <p>The Mongols are an East Asian civilization in Age of Empires II. They focus on mounted archers.</p>
                <p>The Mongols were a collection of nomadic tribes from the steppes of Central Asia and Siberia. 
                    They were fierce warriors who are known for establishing the largest contiguous overland empire in 
                    human history. At the beginning of the 13th century, the Mongol clans became united under Temujin who 
                    later became known as Genghis Khan following a campaign of foreign conquest of more developed and 
                    technologically advanced civilizations across East Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. At its height, 
                    their empire stretched from Korea across Asia and into European Russia to the Baltic Sea coast. They 
                    held most of Asia Minor, modern Iraq, modern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tibet, parts of India, parts 
                    of Burma, all of China, and parts of Vietnam.
